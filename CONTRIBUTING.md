# Contributing

**Contributors to BrainGlobe are absolutely encouraged**, whether to fix a bug, develop a new feature, or add a new atlas.
If you would like to contribute, please take a look at our [developer documentation](https://brainglobe.github.io/new-website/developers/index.html).

There are many BrainGlobe repositories, so it may not be obvious where a new contribution should go.
If you're unsure about any part of the contributing process, please get in touch.
The best place is to start a new discussion on the [image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/tag/brainglobe).
If you tag your post with `brainglobe` (and optionally a specific tool, e.g. `cellfinder`) we will see your question and respond as soon as we can.

If you have a query about contributing to a specific tool, please do raise an issue on the relevant GitHub page.
If it's not the correct repository (e.g. `cellfinder` vs `cellfinder-core`), don't worry, we can move it to the relevant repository later.
If for any reason, you'd rather not reach out in public, feel free to email Adam Tyson, one of the core developers.
